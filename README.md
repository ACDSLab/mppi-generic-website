# MPPI-Generic

MPPI-Generic is a C++/CUDA header-only library for conducting stochastic optimal control in real-time on a NVIDA GPU. It provides implementations of several Dynamics and Cost Functions as well as different iterations of MPPI. In addition, it provides extendable APIs for Dynamics, Cost Functions, Controllers, and more so that researchers can design their own custom classes to push their research forward.
